# giphypraise
giphypraise is an R package that combines the [praise package](https://github.com/rladies/praise) with the [giphy api](https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI). It parses a string to add positive words using the praise package, then searches giphy for a gif using one of those words.

```{r}
library(giphypraise)

# See the Giphy API Github page for more information on keys (https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI)
set_giphy_api_key(readLines("giphy_api_key.txt"))

praise_with_giphy("You are a ${adjective} person, keep up the ${adjective} work!")
```
